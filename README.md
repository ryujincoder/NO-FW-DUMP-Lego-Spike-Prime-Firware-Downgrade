BEFORE WE START YOU MUST HAVE SOME AMOUNT OF KNOW WHAT DIRECTORIES LOOK LIKE AND WHAT THEY ARE. YOU CAN BRICK YOUR DEVICE BUT IT IS VERY VERY NOT LIKELY UNLESS YOU DO STUPID THINGS THAT YOU KNOW ARE DOING WRONG. I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR A BRICKED DEVICE IF THAT HAPPENS.

First open up the Windows disk drive in file explorer then go to; \Program Files\SPIKE\Resouces\ Then right click on the app.asar file and select copy, then paste the app.asar file to your desktop.

Then open the windows disk drive once more and enter the following directiory: \Program Files\7z\ Then there make a Subfoler called "Formats" then enter thet new folder and paste the 32.dll or 64.dll file (depending on the version of 7zip you have) Into the new folder.


Then Move the app.asar file from your desktop to your documents folder in file explorer.


Open 7zip and then open the documents folder then the app.asar file we dragged there. 7z should open the file if not try this. Open the windows disk drive once more and enter the following directiory: \Program Files\7z\Formats\ And replace the 64.dll file with 32.dll file or the 64.dllfile to the 32.dll then reopen the dircetory agin in 7zip.


After you open the app.asar file in 7z enter the following directory: /app/renderer/flipper-hub /firmware/ That .bin file with a bunch of numbers in front of it
